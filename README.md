# Urinals-JUnit

In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing.

For example:

If there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle.

Which means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule.
